Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene. <br/><br/> We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale's back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer.</p><span class="content-title">PRODUCT DETAILS</span></div><div class="picture-wrapper"><div class="pic-1"></div><div class="pic-2"></div><div class="square-frame"></div><div class="square-fill-frame"></div><div class="stripe-frame"></div></div></section></body></html>
